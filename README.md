Code-Together
Code-Together is a web application designed to provide a collaborative coding platform where multiple friends can come together in a single room to share the same editor. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and WebSocket, Code-Together enables real-time collaboration in the following ways:

Features
Real-time Coding: All participants in the room can see code changes live as one friend writes the logic.
Collaborative Debugging: Friends can help identify and rectify errors in real-time, improving the overall code quality.
Instant Feedback and Analysis: Provides a platform for immediate feedback and analysis of the code.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
Backend: WebSocket for real-time communication
Real-time Updates: The shared editor reflects code changes across all connected users instantly.

How it Works
One user creates a room, and others join using a unique room ID.
All participants in the room can view the same code editor.
Any changes made by one user are immediately visible to all other users in real-time.
Every participant has the power to contribute by editing the code and rectifying errors, fostering collaborative problem-solving.

How to Use
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Start the server using npm start.
Share the room ID with your friends and start coding together!

Future Enhancements
Voice chat integration for better communication.
Support for additional programming languages.
Enhanced syntax highlighting and debugging tools.
